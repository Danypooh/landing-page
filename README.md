This is the second project from The Odin Project

In this project I will practice HTML, CSS and Flexbox

Thanks to the web page Pexels for the images, and to the individual photographers I found in there: pexels-lukas, pexels-alex-azabache, pexels-errin-casano, pexels-junior-machado

Also, thanks to OpenClipart-Vectors on pixabay for the png icon of the peru flag
